This is a ArcGIS project I made that shows all the minor variances for the city of Hamilton, Ontario from 2023 and according to each fiscal quarter.

You can also find this project hosted as an ArcGIS web app here: https://indi156a005064a3.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/basic/index.html?appid=cc58702543af4188892e3ceb7a558bb3
